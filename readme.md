# WISH Linux Shell

This is a project where I build a Linux shell using the C language. I have referenced [@MIMA's stories on HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/u/MIMA) for the same. I intend to gain more knowledge about Operating Systems from this and some other projects, most of which will be from [this repository](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects).
